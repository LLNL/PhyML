# PhyML

## Name
Physics based Machine Learning (PhyML)

## Description
This is a repository for the Python scripts for hard constrained sequential physics-informed neural networks (HCSPINNs). This method automatically enforces temporal continuity at time-window interfaces by using interpolation functions. The details of the method and implementation can be found here:
